I am a physicist based in London.

I went to Princeton University for my [doctoral work](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/7660186) on black hole simulations, and to Carleton College for my undergraduate education in [Mathematics](https://www.carleton.edu/math/major/comps/past-comps/2006-07/) and [Physics](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/overview/photo-albums/poster-sessions/2005-posters/).
Now a fellow at Queen Mary University of London and a visiting fellow at Cambridge University, I work to [understand](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/bantilanh.html) the fully non-linear regime of General Relativity with numerical solutions of the Einstein field equations.

I enjoy thinking about important open questions and engaging in vibrant collaborations, give a wide variety of [seminars](https://phy.princeton.edu/events/gravity-group-lunch-seminar-hans-bantilan-qmul-non-spherically-symmetric-collapse) and [talks](http://talks.cam.ac.uk/talk/index/66456) over the course of the year, and am actively engaged in [public outreach](https://igfae.usc.es/igfae/semana-da-ciencia-12-16-november-2018-2/), all of which are important to me and the way that I have found best to operate as a scientist.
