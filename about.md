I am a physicist based in London.

I went to Princeton University for my [doctoral work](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/7660186) on black hole simulations, and to Carleton College for my undergraduate education in Mathematics and Physics.
Now at Queen Mary University of London, I work to [understand](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=exactauthor%3AH.Bantilan.2&sf=earliestdate) the fully non-linear regime of General Relativity with numerical solutions of the Einstein field equations.

I enjoy thinking about important open questions and engaging in vibrant collaborations between different research areas.
I give a wide variety of seminars and talks over the course of the year, and am actively engaged in public outreach, all of which are important to me and the way that I have found best to operate as a scientist.
