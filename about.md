I am a principal data scientist based in London.

I went to Princeton University for my [doctoral work](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/7660186) on black hole simulations, and to Carleton College for my undergraduate education in [Mathematics](https://www.carleton.edu/math/major/comps/past-comps/2006-07/) and [Physics](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/overview/photo-albums/poster-sessions/2005-posters/).
I moved to the UK as a Stephen Hawking Advanced fellow at Cambridge University, and I now conduct cutting-edge research in data science and AI while contributing to the burgeoning data science culture at EF Education First.

I enjoy generating uplift for businesses by thinking about their important open questions and engaging with them in vibrant collaboration. I give a wide variety of [seminars and talks](http://ef.co.uk) over the course of the year, and am actively engaged in [public outreach](https://igfae.usc.es/igfae/semana-da-ciencia-12-16-november-2018-2/), all of which are important to me and the way that I have found best to operate as a scientist.
