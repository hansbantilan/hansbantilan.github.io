I check what's on at [Cadogan Hall](https://cadoganhall.com/), the [Southbank Centre](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/), and the [Royal Albert Hall](https://www.royalalberthall.com/), and regularly attend the musical programs put together by the [London Euphonia Orchestra](https://www.londoneuphonia.com/). 

The [Royal Opera House](https://www.roh.org.uk/) hosts my favorite ballet company.

There is a [milonga](https://londontangocalendar.blogspot.com/p/home.html) every evening of the week in London.

I also enjoy playing instrumental music with the [piano](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596968-7d7f0300-451f-11ea-8199-7aed61188bb1.jpg), the [violin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596972-88d22e80-451f-11ea-8794-426f917980f0.jpg), and the [tabla](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596980-94bdf080-451f-11ea-9835-135f476a338d.jpg).
