I check what's on at [Cadogan Hall](https://cadoganhall.com/whats-on/genres/chamber-recital/), the [Southbank Centre](https://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whats-on?f%5B0%5D=field_api_artform%3A1815), the [Barbican](https://www.barbican.org.uk/whats-on/classical-music), as well as the [Royal Albert Hall](https://www.royalalberthall.com/tickets/?Genres%5B5%5D=5), and regularly attend the musical programs put together by the [London Euphonia Orchestra](https://www.londoneuphonia.com/). 

The [Royal Opera House](https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/all?event-type=ballet-and-dance) hosts my favorite ballet company.

I go to a [milonga](https://londontangocalendar.blogspot.com/p/home.html) every once in a while here in London.

I also enjoy playing instrumental music with the [piano](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596968-7d7f0300-451f-11ea-8199-7aed61188bb1.jpg), the [violin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596972-88d22e80-451f-11ea-8794-426f917980f0.jpg), and the [tabla](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12599167/73596980-94bdf080-451f-11ea-9835-135f476a338d.jpg).
