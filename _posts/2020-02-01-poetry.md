***Cloister***
([m4a](/Cloister.m4a?autoplay=1&loop=1&controls=0))

When everything around you is still

And the restless noise of contemporary life has grown silent

Muffled by the gentle blanket of darkness that only an unlit night can give

Voices and thoughts hush of their own accord.

<br/>

I stepped out from the cloister into the courtyard

Where an ancient oak is spending the twilight years of its life

Just a bit to the side, and of just the right size.

<br/>

I lost my sense of time in that place

In the quiet unassuming darkness

And a thought struck me:

Will I ever be able to find this again

This distance from daily worries

Just enough to be just a little less blind?

***A response***
([m4a](/Prasanthi.m4a?autoplay=1&loop=1&controls=0))

I could sense a nocturnal magical stillness

combined with the 'settled-ness' of something soo old

that it renders our fast paced angst trivial

and compels us to stop and just be.

<br/>

I sometimes find that in the countryside

I experience moments of the sublime.

Like rolling landscapes stretching for miles,

ancient trees and the sea.

<br/><br/>
